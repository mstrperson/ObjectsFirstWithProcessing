# Week 3 Notes
## Objects First
Traditional Computer Science education lacks the kind of magical black boxes that students can take apart and put back together the way we do with more hands on STEM electives.  This Objects-First approach provides students with some of those magical black boxes that can be used without requiring that they fully understand what is going on in the background.  The goal is that by the end of the course, students *should* be able to understand those black boxes well enough to modify and manipulate them to serve their purposes.
